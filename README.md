springBootExcercies

In this spring-boot exercise:
1. A microservice was created to manipulate user table. You will need a docker database to make this work: docker run -p 3306:3306 -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql/mysql-server;
2. Spring boot events(synchronous and asynchronous) were fired when user was created;
3. Spring boot scheduler with cron was used.
